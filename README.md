# USB-MIDI-Controller-Arduino
MIDI plug and play Controller made using a SparkFun Pro Micro.

///// FUNCTIONALITY /////
The current functionality is that it will send MIDI note on/off information with the 3 buttons that are attached, and the two potentiometers will handle Control Changes.
By activating the button near the potentiometers, it will treat the buttons as a way to control which knob you control virtually:
  Clicking the left button moves the knobs to the left by 1, clicking the right moves the knobs to the right.
  This will give you control over 16 different knobs when used correctly.
